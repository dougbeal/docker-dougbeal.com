Preview listen of stories from [Foolscaps](http://foolscap.org) of yore.

Foolscap is a new kind of convention. We bring together writers, artists, fans, thinkers and makers to create a weekend-long conversation about the things that excite us. Everyone is interesting at Foolscap. By bringing together a community of diverse interests and experiences, we make a space where we all learn from each other.
